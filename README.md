This program is to:
 * organize the reservation of space

It is eventually meant to coordinate with a [restaurant](https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/costs) to allow users to organize [working tours](https://github.com/dhappy/tour).

The idea is a map showing where various ameneties are and deliniating exactly what areas are reserved by the renter.
